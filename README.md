This repo is one for a course i did on computational physics. It contains general methods used by Physicists for their research and work like
methods to find roots, solutions, solving ODE, PDE, Monte carlo methods, Variational Monte carlo method etc. 


A1 - Bound States for a finite potential well by solving the Transcendental equations

A2 :
     2_1 : Solving ODE's using <br>
              1.Euler Method <br>
              2.Runge Kutta 2nd order <br>
              3.Runge Kutta 4th order <br>              
     2_2 : Simple Harmonic Motion using <br>
              1. Euler methods <br>
              2. Runge Kutta Method <br>
              3. Varlet Method ( An effective method to solve equations of motion ) <br>
